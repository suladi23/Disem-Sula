# Projects

Below is a selection of data analysis and coding projects I have worked on.

## Project 1: [Analysis of the trends in RD&D spending by
energy technology (1974-2022)]
- **Tools Used**: The whole project was done with a friend on R during the 1st year master. I have upgraded the whole project using python recently.
- **Description**: The goal of the project was initially to analyse the trends in R&D spending in different energy technologies around the world in the past 50 years. The research question was whther there has been a change in the energy technology R&D spending among countries (and group of countries) over the last 50 years and how does it relate to their GDP.
Starting from raw data taken from the IEA that we have cleaned, filtered and merged with GDP data from the world bank.
What we find is a significant decline in the percentage of RD&D investment in nuclear energy technology, the emergence of hydrogen and a rise in energy efficiency and renewables. Though we also found a steady fossil fuel allocation, when we look at G7 countries we find a reduce emphasis on fossil fuel technologies.

## Project 2: [Event Studies analysis around stock splits and Seasoned Equity Offering]
- **Tools Used**: Python
- **Description**: Developing econometrics skills, here we focused on Event Studies as our identification strategy. In this project we performed an event study on stock splits for the year 2010 using CRSP daily return data.
What we are looking for is whether stock splits announcements have an impact on stock returns, looking at abnormal returns (difference between returns given by a model and the actual returns recorded from the data)

## Project 3: [Difference in Difference analysis on firms access to debt given their credit rating]
- **Tools Used**: Python + STATA
- **Description**: Developing econometrics skills, here we focused on Difference in Difference analysis. Difference‐in‐difference analysis of nonfinancial corporate behavior (Compustat firms), using
a data window going from 1985 to 1994 and consider the end of 1989 as the “event date”, when the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) was passed, forcing all savings and loans to eliminate speculative grade debt from their balance sheets.
Here I decided to use mainly python for filtering and for graph visualization, while summary statistics and diff-in-diff regressions were run on STATA (within my jupyter notebook).

## Project 4: [Problem set exercise on Stambaugh (1999) Predictive Regression]
- **Tools Used**: Python
- **Description**: In this problem set we studied the properties of the bias correction presented in Stambaugh (1999) Predictive Regressions, Journal of Financial Economics. After learning the theory in class we were asked to get deeping in the analysis more empyrically as a homework.
