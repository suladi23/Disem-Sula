This research project is located within broader research on the propagation to energy markets of agricultural commodities price change. The research is realized in collaboration with the Collège de France, within the Modeling Agricultural TransitionS (MATS) project.
Before addressing climate impact, it is crucial to better understand the commodity itself and its informational content.

Emission trading system have worked incredibly well in the past (e.g. SO2 emission trading in the 1980s in the US), while today's emission trading system for carbon is receiving many criticisms with respect to its actual impact.
I believe that Carbon markets will at one point find the perfect setup to set out all of the issues it has today, such as low prices, and especially leakages, with companies moving to jurisdictions where regulations can’t reach them, with the EU already on track to tackle that with CBAM.

This research project will be crucial for my future research on Carbon Markets, analysing the structure of a well established commodity market and the behavior of it will give me the experience needed to work on Carbon Markets in the future.

- **Summary**: The objective of this document was to create some literature cards where we analyse several papers and put them altogether for what is going to be the writing of the literature review part of the thesis.
The uploaded file is simply a pdf written on Latex, but the graph in the first page I created it using Obsidian, using tags and using Zotero for references management.
