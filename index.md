# Welcome to My Portfolio

I am an MSc student Research in Finance at University Paris Dauphine PSL, undergoing a PhD Qualifying Year
After completing a first year master degree in Quantitative Economics, I joined the MSc in Research in Finance to specialise in Finance, especially in Sustainable Finance, including energy and commodities to boost the transition to a green economy.  

This site showcases my projects, and other writings undergone during my master.
